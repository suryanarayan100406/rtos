# DRISHTI

**D**rone-based **R**eal-time **I**maging for **S**ingle-pass **H**igh-fidelity **T**errain **I**ntelligence

> *One pass. The whole picture — a georeferenced, measurable 3D model of everything the drone flew
> over, built while it flies.*

**Problem:** NTRO / Smart India Hackathon — **PS-17 / SIH26158** · Category: Software · Theme: Drone /
Robotics — *"Single-Pass Drone Video to Accurate 3D Model Generation System."* Generate a
georeferenced, metrically accurate, textured 3D model from a **single** drone pass — no multi-pass
grids, no extensive Ground Control Points, near-real-time.

## The idea in one paragraph

Classical drone mapping needs many overlapping passes and hours of Structure-from-Motion + Multi-View
Stereo — it cannot handle the "one chance to fly" reality of disaster response, reconnaissance and
rapid mapping. DRISHTI reframes the problem: a single pass gives **weak multi-view geometry** but a
**strong GNSS + temporal signal (inertial when an IMU is present) plus strong learned priors**. So
DRISHTI fuses **feed-forward learned geometry** (permissive MapAnything / Pi3 pointmaps + metric
monocular depth) with a **tightly-coupled visual + GNSS factor graph** (IMU / RTK-PPK / baro folded in
when present) that supplies metric scale and georeference **without GCPs** — from the mandatory
**video + GPS + flight metadata** alone, with camera intrinsics self-calibrated by default — and runs
it as a **streaming, two-tier** system: a live coarse map on the drone's edge computer during flight,
and a full metric textured model on the ground tier in minutes. Every stage emits a confidence signal
and has a fallback, so the system **degrades gracefully and never hard-fails**.

### Implementation (build docs)

> The **build** we are actually shipping: recorded footage + telemetry → one full-quality georeferenced
> 3D model, **offline and ground-only** (no drone/edge deployment, no live path), on modest + free
> compute. This is a ground-only realization of the canonical architecture — see the scope delta in

## Quick facts

- **Architecture:** three tiers (Edge on Jetson Orin · Ground GPU · optional Cloud), two output paths
  (Live coarse map S0–S5 · Refined metric model S6–S10).
- **Inputs (official contract):** *mandatory* — drone video (1080p/4K), GPS coordinates, flight metadata.
  *Optional* — IMU, barometric altitude, camera intrinsics, RTK/PPK. Everything here is designed to run on
  the **mandatory-only** capture, with intrinsics self-calibrated; the optional streams tighten the solve
  where they exist and are never assumed.
- **Accuracy (design targets):** official bar **≤ 1 m** absolute — RTK/PPK → 3–8 cm horizontal (meets
  it comfortably); GPS-only baseline → target sub-metre-to-≤ 1 m, regions > 1 m flagged; GSD ≈ 2 cm/px.
- **Speed (design target):** near-real-time — live coarse map during flight; final model in
  **< 15 min for a 10-minute video** end-to-end on the ground tier.
- **Reliability:** graceful-degradation ladder L0–L6; always emits a best-effort model + uncertainty
  report; store-and-forward so link loss never loses data.
- **Outputs:** LAS/LAZ/PLY point cloud, textured OBJ/glTF-GLB/**FBX**/OGC 3D Tiles mesh, 3DGS scene,
  DSM/DTM + orthomosaic (GeoTIFF), semantic layers, measurements, an accuracy report, and a **web or
  desktop viewer** — covering the required set **OBJ · PLY · LAS · GeoTIFF · .glb/.gltf · .fbx**.
- **Graded on (official weights):** reconstruction accuracy **30%** · model completeness **20%** ·
  processing speed **20%** · innovation **15%** · scalability **10%** · user interface **5%** — quoted
  verbatim in the [problem statement](_internal/PROBLEM_STATEMENT.md) §1a, which is also where every
  target above is sourced from.
